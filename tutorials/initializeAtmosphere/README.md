# Initialize Atmosphere tutorial

## Notes

This tutorial is mean to illustrate how to use the initializeAtmosphere utility. A mesh is created with two regions, one air and one water. The atmosphereProperties file illustrates both hydrostatic and table based initialization. The initial volume fractions are set prior to initializing the pressure fields. After the pressure has been set, the left, air region, is set to a uniform value.
