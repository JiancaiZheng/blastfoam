# Reacting Shock tube

## Notes

This is an illustrative case on how to use blastFoam with a simplechemistry. A single methane reaction is used, with two regions: The left containing 77% Nitrogen and 23& Oxygen at STP. The right region is pure methane at 10 atm and 500K. An Euler ODE solver for the chemistry reactions.

The calculation took approx. 30 s to run on a single core laptop at using 500 cells.
