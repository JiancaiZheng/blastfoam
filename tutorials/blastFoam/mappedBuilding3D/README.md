# mapped building 3D

## Notes

These cases are to show how to use the rotateFields utility to run a refined 1D/2D case to initialize a refined solution and then rotate to a 3D case.

The sector set of cases takes approximately 2 minutes to run the wedge case take approximately 10 minutes, both on a four core desktop.
