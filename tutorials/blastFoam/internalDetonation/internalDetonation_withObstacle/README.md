# Internal detonation tutorial

## Notes

This is a simple case to show an example case in a confined domain using an explosive material that has additional reactions occur after the initial detonation. The Miller afterburn model is used to additional energy (from heat of formation) in to the system. This case is used for comparison with the 'internalDetonation_withObstacleAndGlass' case.

The case uses adaptive mesh refinement, and takes approximately 5 min to complete on a four core desktop.
