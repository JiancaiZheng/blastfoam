# Shock tube tabulated tutorial

## Notes

This case is used to show the ability to use a tabulated equation of state and thermodynamic model in the context of a simple shock tube. The provided tables were created using an ideal gas with a specific heat ratio of 1.4. Any table can be used as long as pressure and temperature tables are provided as a function of density and internal energy.

The case took approximately 10 s to complete on a single core desktop.
