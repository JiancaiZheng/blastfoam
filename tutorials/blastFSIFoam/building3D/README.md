# Building 3-D with FSI tutorial

## Notes

This case is designed to show a simple 3-D case setup using an STL file with snappyHexMesh and adaptive mesh refinement. The a c-4 charge placed inside a L-Shaped building. The c-4 is activated using the linear activation model. This cases also uses fluid structure interaction where the pressure is used to deform the solid wall and the solids use a linear-elastic material model.

The case takes approximately 6 min to run on a four-core desktop.
